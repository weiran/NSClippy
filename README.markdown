# NSClippy

## Clippy for iOS

NSClippy is a port of [ClippyJS](https://www.smore.com/clippy-js) for that nostalgic hit on iOS. My thanks to [smore](https://www.smore.com) for providing the original sprites and sounds.

## Installation

Either manually copy all the files from the NSClippy directory (excluding the Example) into your project, or you can add it via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) by putting this line into your podfile:

	pod 'NSClippy'

## Todo

* Show random idle animation
* Add speech bubble pop over
* Queue for animations
* Add other characters such as Merlin, Rover, and Links.
